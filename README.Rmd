All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that you are done with your submission.

TL;DR Summary - Bhargav Yellepeddi:

The analysis of Ames property sales since 2017 shows most sales between $100Kâ€“$400K. Total living area follows a normal distribution, with outliers. A positive correlation exists between living area and sale price, though it weakens for larger properties. Missing data led to 447 rows being excluded.
